        <h2>Learning Plan</h2>

        <p>
            <ul>
                <li>What is your long term goal and/or career pathway?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Have the coding skills to get an entry level job in a company I respect, doing some sort of web development (Front end - back end - full stack), or software development in general (game dev, security, fintech?, etc). </li>
                        <li>Have the learning skills foundation required to build upon my knowledge efficiently once I am working in the industry.</li>
                        <li>Have the human skills required to build and maintain a good network of friends to collaborate with.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>A description of your own strengths and limitations in relation to learning</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Strength: I think I am naturally good at thinking logically and intuitively, and I have practiced this throughout my engineering study and work. I also have some experience in the course content already which will help.</li>
                        <li>Strength: Throughout my engineering study and work I demonstrated a love of helping and collaborating with other people. I find that teaching someone something that I have learnt, a great way to cement it in my own knowledge! And I love solving tough problems with other people.</li>
                        <li>Limitation: Since birth, all my formal education has been based on principles belonging to the industrial age. Therefore my brain is currently trained in the industrial aged style of education. Thanks to neuroplasticity, I have the opportunity to practice and improve my ability to learn in a futuristic(?) way. However, I will need to be careful that I don’t slip back into “Just in case learning” as opposed to “Just in time learning”.</li>
                        <li>Limitation: While having the internet at my finger-tips has revolutionised my education, it is also the greatest distraction. </li>
                    </ul>
                <li>What skills (non-technical - human skills) would you like to see developed in yourself while at Dev Academy?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>As mentioned under the first bullet-point; coding skills required for an entry level job as a web dev or software dev in general, learning skills required to help me grow in the industry and the  human skills required to build and maintain a good network of web dev related friends! </li>
                        <li>More specifically:</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Coding Skills: </li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The ability to plan and complete projects start to finish</li>
                                        <li>The ability to plan and track my coding hours accurately and efficiently.</li>
                                        <li>The ability to effectively collaborate on projects with other coders</li>
                                    </ul>
                                <li>Learning Skills:</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Improving my use of the internet and limiting its use of me (focus skills primarily).</li>
                                        <li>Increasing my efficiency at using Google, other search engines, code help forums or my own intuition to solve problems I run into.</li>
                                        <li>Skills in knowing what to know and what to skip. Related to “just in time learning” as opposed to “just in case learning”. Due to my entire life until now, consisting of “just in case learning”, I probably have a built in default mode of trying to consume all the content in sight, as I am subconsciously scared that I may need to know off by heart someday (irrational I know). Once I get into the industry, how will I continue my “just in time learning”? For example, if there are new languages building popularity, will I be anxious if I am not learning them?</li>
                                    </ul>
                                <li>Human Skills:</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Skills in meeting people that could be good to collaborate with. Dev Academy will be a great place to practice this and the wider EDA community too. However, once I am in the industry, how can I expand my skills to continue growing my network?</li>
                                    </ul>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>
                <li>A commitment to how you will manage your workload in this programme. This should include:</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>An explanation of how you will manage yourself to work productively and safely with other learners, facilitators and industry/community representatives</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I will look out for myself and the people working around me to ensure that we are staying healthy while we work hard!</li>
                                <li>I will manage myself by planning things out in advance, while also staying flexible to make the most of good opportunities. I will use timeboxing to ensure that I don’t go down the rabbit hole on things too often!</li>
                                <li>I will work really hard! and smart!</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>What you will do when things are building up and starting to get to you</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>How will I deal with requests for help from other students If I myself am on a strict countdown for a deadline or I am already feeling overworked? - communicate my time resources clearly with my team.</li>
                                <li>I will manage stress through being mindful, and not procrastinating. Get things done before they build up!</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>A commitment as to how and where you will seek help in a timely way</li>
                            <li>My first point of help will be myself. What am I missing? typo? semi-colon</li>
                            <li>Second point of contact will be Google, or another search engine or code help forum. Has anyone else experienced this?</li>
                            <li>Thirdly, I will go to my cohort for help, but this will start with me formulating the problem for them. What is going on? What am I trying to do? What attempts to solve the problem have I taken already? etc… A lot of the time, I suspect I will realise something I need to try before actually sending the message out to others.</li>
                            <li>I am confident that as a cohort we will be able to solve most problems together.</li>
                            <li>I am confident that as a cohort we will be able to solve most problems together.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>A description of what you expect from the facilitation team</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Unsure what to expect. TODO: discuss with facilitator</li>
                        <li>Guide me in my exploration of different career options</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>Any scheduling information such as block-out times when you are committed to other things. For example, you might have whānau commitments like school drop-offs. It’s important to plan these in.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I have Korean Language lessons every thursday 6-8 pm, online during lockdowns, in the cbd otherwise. Will need to leave bootcamp 5-5:30pm. </li>
                        <li>Apart from that no other commitments. I like to get some exercise daily, preferably during daylight.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>These elements do not need to be structured as they are in this list. You should put them together in the way that you feel they are most clearly communicated.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>I like lists.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
