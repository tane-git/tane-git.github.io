            <p>
                <span>In summary, the strengths and areas for development I identified from this personality assessment tool are:</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Introverted: I am comfortable alone with my own thoughts, which helps me stay focussed and find flow when working through a difficult problem solo. This does not limit my ability to work well in a team! </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Intuition: I enjoy being open-minded and exploring future possibilities. Tech will be an awesome industry to do this however, at the same time there will be procedures and standards that I will have to familiarise myself with. Being Observant of what has happened in the industry already and respecting its reasons for existence will be an important area for development.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Thinking: I am good at using logic. I refined this while completing a degree in Structural Engineering. An area for development will be in learning how to incorporate my feelings more in a good way, when making decisions.</span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>Tactics: I have strengths in both Judging and Prospecting Tactics. I have shown evidence of being both good at planning and staying flexible. My main focus area for development is in improving the harmony between these two sides of the spectrum in my life as whole. So that my work is not ruled by plans while my free time is awash with randomness. </span>
            </p>
            <p>
                <span>The personality test helped me identify some values that are important to me.</span>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <span>Truth - and therefore honesty. While objective truth is very mysterious to us, I still value all the truth I can get and find it hard to follow ideologies and hard to become motivated just by stories. </span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>Love - care for others and oneself</span>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <span>I value Working Hard and Smart, not just for the sake of it, but for Meaning. A Meaning supported by Truth and Love.</span>
                </li>
            </ul>

                    <li>
                        <span>How should I spend my time? I am surrounded by distractions and things that will make me momentarily happy. There are millions of people playing video games right now and it would be awesome to go and join them. And there &rsquo;s nothing I would prefer to be doing, than riding some mountain bike trails in native bush or snowboarding down mountains.</span>

                    <li>
                        <span>But there are billions of people who are struggling just to live. How can I go off on care-free bike rides or zone-out playing video games when countless people are starving each day. </span>

                    <li>
                        <span>I was raised in an atheist household. As someone that often found themselves thinking about life &#39;s big questions, I was often extremely jealous of my classmates that had a religion to give them great meaning in their life. </span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>I enjoyed discussing with my friends that were religious, what they believed in. It was interesting hearing comforting stories of afterlife adventures when I had always just been told &ldquo;Nothing &rdquo;when I asked what happened after death. However, the stories never gripped or convinced me and sometimes I was left feeling pretty nihilistic. </span>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <span>As I grew up, I found ways to cope with the scary implications of my lack of beliefs and always found the concept of Truth, though scary at first, oddly comforting. Despite not being religious myself, I am very open-minded and can have great respect for people &#39;s beliefs, however I can also be very critical of them internally.</span>

                    <li>
                        <span>In terms of my values and identity. I value Truth and Love. I don &rsquo;t identify as an atheist, as I don &rsquo;t have any answers, nor do I spend any time trying to change people &#39;s beliefs, preferring to attempt to understand them. &nbsp;</span>

                        <span>Introvert: I am comfortable alone with my thoughts which is a strength when tasked with solving tough problems on my own. However, this is rarely the best way to solve great problems, where team cooperation is essential. </span>

                        <span>Intuition: I am open-minded and imaginative which will be great for the flipped learning style of this course and the innovative industry of tech. However, I will need to ensure that I recognise the reasons for current procedures and standards and give them due respect.</span>

I can use time-management to ensure that I do not get overburdened with work, while still giving myself time for rest and exercise.

                        <span>Throughout university there were many large group projects where some people would seem to put no effort in. At the time I would try and inspire them by </span>

It often wasn &rsquo;t very effective and would leave me thinking: why didn &rsquo;t you take that opportunity to contribute to the project when you were given it? I would have, most people would have? </span>

                        <span>In reflection, I now realise how different everyone is. We all have different strengths and limitations and different tasks and appealing/daunting to different people. Giving people the freedom to choose how they contribute to a project is difficult when delegating tasks and leading a team, but it is very important.</span>
