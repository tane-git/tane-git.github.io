                <span class="c3">In summary, the strengths and areas for development I identified from this personality assessment tool are:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c9">
                <span class="c3">Introverted: I am comfortable alone with my own thoughts, which helps me stay focussed and find flow when working through a difficult problem solo. This does not limit my ability to work well in a team! </span>
            </p>
            <p class="c9">
                <span class="c3">Intuition: I enjoy being open-minded and exploring future possibilities. Tech will be an awesome industry to do this however, at the same time there will be procedures and standards that I will have to familiarise myself with. Being Observant of what has happened in the industry already and respecting its reasons for existence will be an important area for development.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c9">
                <span class="c3">Thinking: I am good at using logic. I refined this while completing a degree in Structural Engineering. An area for development will be in learning how to incorporate my feelings more in a good way, when making decisions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="c9">
                <span class="c3">Tactics: I have strengths in both Judging and Prospecting Tactics. I have shown evidence of being both good at planning and staying flexible. My main focus area for development is in improving the harmony between these two sides of the spectrum in my life as whole. So that my work is not ruled by plans while my free time is awash with randomness. </span>

                <span class="c3">The personality test helped me identify some values that are important to me.</span>
