                    <ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>Believing in it in the first place makes a fundamental difference to someone's potential.</li>
                                <li>It reinforces the common saying “Practice makes perfect” - allowing people to realise that while they may not be naturally gifted in some domain, they still have the potential to become really good at it. </li>
                            </ul>
                        <li class="parent">Discuss how you might engage with the principles of neuroplasticity for your own benefit</li>
                            <ul>                
                                <li>I will believe that I can become really good at programming and work towards that goal. I will practice, practice, practice, to reinforce neural networks responsible for my skills. </li>
                            </ul>
                        <li class="parent">What are some of the ways to increase your neuroplasticity?</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Keep an open mind! Don’t get stuck in one way of thinking because it doesn’t have to be the only way</li>
                                <li>Exercise - a huge proportion of our brain is responsible for moving our bodies, if we stop moving and become too sedentary, this part of our brain will deteriorate. </li>
                                <li>Just believing in neuroplasticity will increase your neuroplasticity. Remember that practice can make perfect!</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li class="parent">Link to a resource that you found particularly useful or engaging.</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6kM-NwXyh7M">10 principles of Neuroplasticity explained in less than 1 minute each</a></li>
                                <li>I found that this video covered a lot of ground quickly (especially if you watch it at x1.5 speed). </li>
                                <li>I found it bizarrely relatable as I am a snowboarder (and the video used snowboarding as an example throughout) and I have also used squatting as a way to prepare for the snowboarding season, but found picking up skateboarding much more helpful!</li>
                            </ul>

                <li class="parent">Research Growth Mindset</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li class="parent">Discuss what it is and why it is relevant</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>When confronted with a difficult challenge,  people react on a spectrum of; </li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>This is far too hard for me, I quit, to...</li>
                                        <li> This is far too hard for me, how exciting, how do I get better? </li>
                                    </ul>
                                <li>The people that react with the motivation to improve and therefore step up to solve the challenge, grow more, than those that run from the challenge. </li>
                                <li>It is relevant to everyone as we all face challenges and we decide to run or face them. If it is a good challenge (although hard) then we should face it, and realise that we just can’t solve it ‘yet’ but that it is not impossible.</li>
                            </ul>
                        <li class="parent">In this exploration, did anything surprise you? Change for you?</li>
                            <ul>                
                                <li>Not really surprising as I think I had always known this subconsciously, however it is nice to hear it explained with a backing of scientific research and explanation. The change will be moving it from subconscious to conscious awareness.  </li>
                            </ul>
                        <li class="parent">How will you integrate a growth mindset into your learning journey?</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Work at a speed that challenges me and forces me to grow. </li>
                                <li>Put in the required effort to face, understand and solve problems that are too hard for my current abilities. Stimulating growth.</li>
                                <li>Encourage my team mates to grow, and vice versa. </li>

                                    <li>I covered this content in the pre-curriculum, the weekend before foundations started, so I made my learning plan and strategy with this in mind. It is good to get a refresher and things are going well so far!</li></ol>
