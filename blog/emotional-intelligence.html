        <h2>What is emotional intelligence? 
          <br> How does it differ to IQ and why is it important? </h2>

        <p>IQ stands for intelligence quotient, and generally as a society, we consider it to be a measure of one's ability to use logic to solve problems. 
        <br><br>
        Therefore, I think Emotional intelligence can be thought of as one's ability to use their intelligence to solve problems that are based on human emotion. 
        <br><br>
        So fundamentally, emotional intelligence is a subset of intelligence. But what is intelligence? To explore this I went to youtube…

        <p class="centered">
        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ck4RGeoHFko" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
        <p>

        This video proposees three fundamental tools of intelligent beings:
        <ol>
        <li>Sensing Information</li>
        <li>Memory</li>
        <li>Learning</li>
        </ol>

        The video then goes on to talk about more complex tools, all the way up to describing culture as a tool of intelligence. But for simplicity I am going to stick at the level of the first 3 fundamental tools. 
        <br><br>
        If we accept that these 3 tools are fundamental for intelligence, then they also apply to emotional intelligence. 
        <br><br>
        First, we have the ability to sense people's emotions (including our own). 
        Secondly, we have the ability to remember patterns in these emotions and how they relate to things that happened. 
        Thirdly, we have the ability to learn new and better ways of dealing with emotions. 
        <br><br>
        We all have some level of emotional intelligence, and everyone will have differing skill levels in each fundamental tool. 
        <br><br>
        For example:
        <br>
        Someone may be realy good at sensing their own emotions but poor at identifying other people's emotions. However, when they rarely do identify someones emotions, they have an excellent memory of it. 
        <br>
        Even though they may be good at sensing their own emotions, their memory of it is poor, and therefore they fail to see patterns in their behaviour. 
        <br>
        Because they lack skill in the first two tools (sensing and remembering), they haven't developed their learning (third tool) to their full potential yet. 
        <br><br>
        This is just one random example to show how complicated someone's emotional intelligence level can be. It can have different dimensions with different strengths and weaknesses.  
        <br><br>
        Emotional Intelligence is important because working in teams is vital to solving today’s world’s problems. And when working in teams, human emotions are bound to arise and become very important in regards to the function of the team. 
        <br><br>
        Teams should try and improve their emotional intelligence by remembering the three fundamental tools of intelligence and practicing them.
