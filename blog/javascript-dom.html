              <h4>A HTML and CSS analogy</h4>
              My favourite analogy I have heard so far 
              <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gT0Lh1eYk78">(from YouTube)</a>
              personifies the 
              three languages as a builder, an artist and a wizard/witch. The builder is HTML, they are responsible for the core content.
              The artist is CSS and they are responsible for how things look. And the magic is all done by Javascript.

              <h4>Explaination of control flow and loops using an every day example</h4>
              A cities road network has signs at junctions indicating what is in each direction. We can think of them as 'if' statements
              "if" you want to go to the North Shore then take this road. "While" you are on this road don't go more than 80km/h.

              <h4>What is the DOM? ...and an example of how you might interact with it</h4>
              The DOM can be thought of as a tree structure with nodes. One example of how we interact with it is by going down different branches to find the elements we want.

              <h4>Difference between accessing data from arrays and objects</h4>
              An array is a list of items and we can access each item by using square brackets containing the position of the item we want.
              Objects have properties that contain values, and you can access these properties by typing objectName.propertyName.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>
              <h4>What are functions? Why are they useful?</h4>
              Functions have code inside of them that we can execute by calling the function. Being able to execute the code just by calling the function 
              is useful as it gives us a level of abstraction.
