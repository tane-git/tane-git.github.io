        <h2>Foundations Reflection</h2>
        <p>
            <ul>
                <li class="parent">What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as a result of the core learning?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The ego wants to stay in the brain it is currently living in. But the brain is plastic and can change if you start to teach it new habits. The ego may be much happier in its new and improved home. </li>
                        <li>I will learn more if I stop trying to learn everything just in case, and focus on just learning what I need to complete my goals. </li>
                        <li>Focus takes practice, lots of practice.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li class="parent">What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and programming?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Programming computers gives great power and therefore a lot of responsibility. Values are responsible for how we choose to use that power. Empathy determines how we use it to help others, and help others with programming. Self awareness is important as programming is hard. And it is easy to not treat yourself properly while you are focussed on programming. For example, stay self aware to ensure you are staying focussed, not being too self-critical, give yourself patience, and also fulfill your bodies needs in terms of diet, sleep and exercise (plus many more).</li>
                    </ul>
                <li class="parent">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Seeing how everyone got something different out of it. For some people it primarily helped them boost their self confidence, others their focus, or helped them identify their values more clearly.</li>
                    </ul>    
                <li class="parent">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Creating blog posts required translating thoughts in my head into words that other people could understand. Everyone has different backgrounds, languages and values, and therefore what you are thinking in your own head will not be fully comprehensible to someone else, even if they could read your mind.</li>
                    </ul>
                <li class="parent">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Programming is hard. and you need a solid core to tackle the life that comes with programming.</li>
                        <li>Programming is time consuming, and its easy to forget the other aspects of what makes you a good programmer, aside from the actual programming.</li>
                        <li>Employers and clients and looking for programers that are good people!</li>
                    </ul>
                <li class="parent">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practising programming instead? Justify your answer.</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>No, itâ€™s not wasted time. I now understand my values more clearly, have a better understanding of my brain and have goals set up to achieve.</li>
                    </ul>    
            </ul>
