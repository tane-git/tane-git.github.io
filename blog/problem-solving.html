                <ol>
                        <li class="parent">A story about a time I got blocked on a simple problem</li>
                                <ul>
                                        <li>There are countless times when I got blocked on a simple problem and the problem is usually a missing, extra or wrong character. For example a missing colon, or calling your variable testScore instead of testScores.
                                                <br><br>
                                                The best way to solve these problems is to stay calm. Re-read through your code and hopefully spot your error
                                                <br><br>
                                                However, it is sometimes hard to stay calm when you don't know it's just a simple error. What if there is something fundamentally wrong with your code?  
                                                <br><br>
                                                That's when the wider range of problem solving methods come in handy!
                                        </li>
                                </ul>
                        <li class="parent">A story about a time I solved a problem in an elegant way</li>
                                <ul>
                                        <li>The Zen Garden task got us to format a decent sized html file that was a mess.
                                                <br><br>
                                                I was not a fan of this task at all. Going through it, line by line, trying to figure out how each line should be formatted was tedious and boring. If only I was a better programmer I could just automate this!
                                                <br><br>
                                                Just as I was almost done, I stopped to have some lunch. After a nice lunch I came back to my computer and I had multiple VS code windows open for different tasks. To clean up my desktop, I closed the ones I wasn't working on, and also closed ZEN GARDEN WITHOUT SAVING.
                                                <br><br>
                                                I was not ready to go through it all again. It was fine, I'll just skip that task, who cares... But I decided to give it another go but with a more tactical approach. I researched some handy keyboard shortcuts that would help me navigate the large document (namely jump to html tag pair and select content between html tag pairs) and re-did the tasks
                                                <br><br>
                                                By formatting the document as a whole, instead of line-by-line and with my new keybindings in place. I managed to complete the task much more efficiently!
                                        </li>
                                </ul>
                        <li class="parent">Reflecting on how confident I feel using the problem solving techniques listed</li>
                                <ul>
                                        <li>Pseudocode</li>
                                                <ul>
                                                        <li>Relatively comfortable! It does help to layout some pseudocode before you write some code that is adventuring out of your comfort zone.
                                                                <br><br>
                                                                I am unsure when to leave the pseudocode in the final code as comments, or remove them to clean up the file.
